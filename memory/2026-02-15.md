- Site deploy progress: Repo timondik-cell/clawd made public. GitHub Pages enabled on branch chore/remove-node_modules. Preview live at https://timondik-cell.github.io/clawd/. Added basic index.html remotely.

- Exec access enabled: Patched config to tools.exec.security=allowlist with safeBins: git, gh, nano, pandoc, python3. Allows remote commands for automation.

- User preference: For terminal instructions, put exact pasteable commands in code boxes only (no extra text/comments inside). Saved to MEMORY.md.

- Used sub-agent for UI automation on Mac mini to update GitHub settings via browser tool (profile=chrome, attached tab).
